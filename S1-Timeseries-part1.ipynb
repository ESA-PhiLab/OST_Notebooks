    "The results returned by the search algorithm on Copernicus scihub might not be 100% appropriate to what we are looking for. In this step we refine the results adressing possible issues and reduce later processing needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A first step **splits the data** by **orbit direction** (i.e. ascending and descending) and **polarization mode** (i.e. VV, VV/VH, HH, HH/HV) and checks the coverage for the resulting combinations (e.g. descending VV/VH polarization). If one combination results in a non-full overlap to the AOI, all further steps are disregarded. In case a full coverage is possbile further refinement steps are taken: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Some of the acquisition frames might have been processed and/or stored **more than once** in the ESA ground segment. Therefore they appear twice, with the scene identifier that only changes for the last 4 digits. It is necessary to identify those scenes in order to avoid redundancy. We therefore take the ones with the latest ingestion date to assure the use of the latest processor. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some of the scenes returned by the search query are actually **not overlapping the AOI**. This is because the search algorithm will actually check for data within a square defined by the outer bounds of the AOI geometry and not the AOI itself. The refinement only takes those frames overlapping with the AOI in order to reduce unnecassary processing later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the case of **ascending tracks that cross the equator**, the **orbit number** of the frames will **increase by 1** even though they are practically from the same acquisition. During processing the frames need to be merged and the relative orbit numbers (i.e. tracks) should be the same. The metadata in the inventory is therefore updated in order to normalize the relative orbit number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. (optional) The tracks of Sentinel-1 overlap to a certain degree. The data inventory might return tracks that only **marginally cross the AOI**, but there AOI overlap is already covered by the adjacent track. Thus, if tracks do not contribute to the overall overlap of the AOI, they are disregarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. (optional) Some acquisitions might **not cross the entire AOI**. For the subsequent time-series/timescan processing this becomes problematic, since the generation of the time-series will only consider the overlapping region for all acquisitions per track.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A similar issue appears when one track **crosses the AOI twice**. In other words some of the frames in the middle of the track are not overlapping the AOI and are already disregarded by step 2. The assembling of the non-subsequent frames during processing would result in a failure. The metadata in the inventory is consequently updated, where the first part of the relative orbit number will be renamed to XXX.1, the second part to XXX.2 and so on. During processing those acquistions will be handled as 2 different tracks, and only merged during the final mosaicking.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. (optional) A last step is needed to assure that for one mosaic in time that consists of different tracks, is only covered once by each track. "
