# OST_Notebooks

This repo is being archived shortly, and the most up to date notebooks, along with installation instructions and other OST information, are now held here: https://opensartoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example/index.html 

The notebooks within this repository provide *getting started* tutorials for the use of the Open SAR Toolkit, found here in the ESA-philab github channel.

Just clone them and get started. Note that for processing exercises you will need sufficient disk space and processing power.

There is the possibility to run them on Google Colab
